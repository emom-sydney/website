Last Friday's EMOM gathering was an absolute highlight for the Sydney electronic music community. With 12 incredible performances and a packed venue, the energy was electric!

## Highlights

Some standout performances included:

- **Synth Club** with an ambient exploration using modular synths
- **IV909** bringing raw, pulsing techno energy
- **Unkraut** delivering experimental sound design

## What Made It Special

The diversity of styles on display was remarkable — from deep house to industrial noise to ambient soundscapes. This is what EMOM is all about: providing a platform for artists to express themselves freely and authentically.

Thanks to everyone who came out and supported the performers. Mark your calendars for the next event on **February 13th**!
