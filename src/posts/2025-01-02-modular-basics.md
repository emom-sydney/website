Modular synthesis can seem intimidating at first, but the fundamentals are surprisingly approachable. Whether you're considering getting into modular or just curious about how it works, this guide will get you started.

## The Basics

A modular synthesizer is essentially a collection of specialized sound-generating and sound-shaping modules that you patch together with cables. Each module performs a specific function.

### Key Modules

**Oscillators**: The heart of any synth, these generate the basic waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle).

**Filters**: These remove frequencies from the signal, allowing you to shape the timbre and tone.

**Envelope Generators (EGs)**: These control how a sound evolves over time — attack, decay, sustain, and release.

**LFOs**: Low-frequency oscillators modulate other parameters to create dynamic, evolving sounds.

## Patching Your First Sound

Start simple: route an oscillator through a filter, then into an amplifier. Use an LFO to modulate the filter cutoff. Add an envelope generator to the amplifier for volume control.

That's it! You've created the building blocks for countless sounds. From here, experimentation is your best teacher.

## Next Steps

If you're interested in exploring modular synthesis, consider visiting a local music shop to try one, or check out some of the affordable boutique modular systems available today. Many EMOM performers use modular rigs — come chat with them about their setups at the next event!
