<h2>Performer Registration</h2>
<p>Registration form closed for maintenance, and we're now fully booked for November (with one slot free for walk-ups on the night - first in best dressed :) 


<!-- Please <a href="mailto:emom.sydney@gmail.com">email us</a> if you'd like to play at a later event.</p> -->


<!-- 
<p>If you wish to play at our event, you just need to show up on the night. That's what "open mic" means after all :) 
<p>Having said that, we realise it's a bit different when you've got a boot load of gear to wrangle, so you can pre-register your intention to play by filling out this form.
